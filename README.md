Open Exoskeletal Finger Mechanisms (Experimental)

An open, experimental mechanical research project exploring new architectures for structurally protective, force-transmitting, articulated exoskeletal mechanisms.

⚠️ Read This First

This repository contains experimental mechanical research artifacts.

These designs are:

Physical

Working

Incomplete

Not yet generalized

Not yet robustly scalable

Not yet a finished architecture

They represent reference mechanisms and research artifacts, not products.

They are not safety-certified and not intended for use on humans.

What This Project Is

This is an open, experimental, mechanical research project exploring new architectures for structurally protective, force-transmitting, articulated exoskeletal mechanisms.

The goal of this project is to explore a family of mechanical solutions for compact, efficient finger mechanisms, and to evolve these architectures over time through iteration, failure, and community contribution.

This is the beginning of a lineage, not the end of a design process.

What You Are Getting Right Now

The current public releases include:

A complete articulated middle finger mechanism composed of three phalanx subassemblies

A complete ring finger variant with additional architectural features and variants

Sub-variants of the above for proximal attachment geometry (standalone vs glove-integrated)

These releases are:

Fixed-size

Not universally scalable without time-consuming iteration and frequent model failure

Known to fail when pushed outside certain geometric or load regimes

Still exploring fundamental architectural questions (including whether the final system will require multiple joint solution families, not one)

Scaling, resizing, or adapting these designs currently requires engineering judgment, iteration, and often failure.

That is expected.

What This Is Not

This is not:

A product

A kit

A turnkey system

A prosthetic

A medical device

A rehabilitation device

A safety-certified mechanism of any kind

It is also not:

Fully validated

Fully optimized

Fully documented

Finished

Safety and Use Disclaimer

These mechanisms are released for research, educational, and experimental purposes only.

They are not designed, tested, or approved for use on the human body.

Do not use them on yourself or anyone else.

Do not use them in any application where failure could cause injury or damage.

You assume all responsibility for anything you build, modify, or test based on these designs.

About the Open / Medical Split

This project is intentionally split into two conceptual paths:

An open research / maker / experimental path (this repository and these releases)

A separate, protected medical / clinical development path

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as a medical device or a step toward clinical use.

Philosophy

This project is not about finding one perfect design.

It is about exploring a design space.

It is likely that the final system will involve:

Multiple joint architectures

Multiple routing strategies

Multiple structural strategies

Multiple scaling regimes

The current releases are checkpoints in that exploration.

In Short

It is incomplete.
It is experimental.
It is not safe.
It is not finished.

It is a beginning.

About AI-Assisted Content

Some portions of the documentation, illustrations, diagrams, and presentation materials for this project may be created or refined using AI-assisted tools.

These tools are used strictly to:

Improve clarity of communication

Assist with document composition and layout

Generate or clean up minor illustrative graphics and explanatory diagrams

They are not used to:

Design the mechanisms

Generate the engineering

All mechanical designs, architectural decisions, and physical prototypes in this project are the result of human design, iteration, and real-world experimentation.

Assembly

This is an early research release. Assembly procedures are documented primarily in the build video. Written instructions may be added later as the design stabilizes.
